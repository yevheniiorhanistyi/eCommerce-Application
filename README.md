<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you can run a project locally. Follow these simple steps as an example.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:yevheniiorhanistyi/eCommerce-Application.git
   ```

   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

### Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command:
```
   npm start
```
The application will be launched in development mode and can be accessed at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).


### Code Formatting and Linting

This project uses ESLint and Prettier for code formatting and linting. Husky is also configured to run pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality. Before committing changes, the pre-commit hooks will automatically format the code using Prettier and check for linting errors using ESLint.

To format the code using Prettier manually, use the following command:
```
   npm run prettier
```
To run ESLint for TypeScript and JSX files, use the following command:
```
   npm run lint
```

### Testing

To run tests, use the following command:
```
   npm test
```

### Building the Project

To create an optimized production build of the project, use the following command:
```
   npm run build-prod
```

## Preview

Before running the preview, make sure you have a production build ready by running the `npm run build-dev` or  `npm run build-prod`  command.

To preview the build and see how the application works in production mode, use the following command:
```
   npm run preview
```

## Available Commands
In the BUYIT application, there are also other commands available that can be useful

- `npm run pretty:fix`: To automatically fix Prettier formatting for TypeScript, JSX, and JSON files.
- `npm run lint:fix`: To automatically fix ESLint errors for TypeScript and JSX files.
- `npm run build-dev`: To build the project without minification.
- `npm run test:coverage`: To run tests with code coverage report.
